MWM Toolbox
=========

The MWM Matlab Toolbox is a series of Matlab functions for analyzing Morris Water-Maze data. To use
it, you must have Matlab version 7 or greater. Additionally, if you want to be able to use some of
the more advanced analysis methods you will need to install Alexander Ihler's Kernel Density
Estimation Toolbox (http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ihler/code/kde.html).
