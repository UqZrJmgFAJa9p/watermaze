To install and use the MWM Toolbox Matlab version 7 or greater must be installed. If it is installed
then the toolbox can simply be downloaded to a folder on the Matlab path and it is ready to use.

The only complication is if the pdf functions are to be used (e.g. mwmpdf.m). In this case Alexander
Ihler's KDE Toolbox must also be installed. See http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ihler/code/kde.html to
download the KDE Toolbox and for installation instructions. Note that installing the KDE toolbox
requires a C++ compiler.
