function K = getkld(DATA)

% function K = getkld(DATA)
%
% Returns the Kullback-Leibler divergences from a data set. Both mwmpdf and mwmkld must have been
% run first.
%
% MANDATORY INPUTS:
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
%   DATA - DATA is a cell array that contains the raw water-maze data for a given collection of 
%          project files in the study. See 'help readwmdf' for details.
%
% OUTPUT:
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
%   K - A T x A matrix of latencies, where T is the maximum number of trials and A is the number of
%       animals.
